  <p>Lulu was born on October 6, 2013. She is a short-haired, red-headed, chihuahua;
     and yes, the Taco Bell chihuahua is her soulmate. Named after a popular League
     of Legends champion, she embodies the character's spunky attitude and adorable
     stature. Her favorite food is chicken, but she is not very picky! Her biggest
     phobia is abnormally large cats. Lulu enjoys smelling a variety of different
     scents. Some of those include: poop, rocks, and of course, chicken.
